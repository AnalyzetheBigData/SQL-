## Example of a CTE All Customer Count - Common Table Expression in SQL 
all_customer_count_cte AS (
  SELECT E.country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT E.country) AS top5_customer_count
  FROM country E
  INNER JOIN city D ON E.country_id = D.country_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON D.city_id = C.city_id
  INNER JOIN customer B ON C.address_id = B.address_id
  GROUP BY E.country
